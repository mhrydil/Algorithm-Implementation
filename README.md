# Algorithm Implementation
Github repository for Algorithm Implementation with Dr. Ramirez, Summer 2019 at University of Pittsburgh


**Assignment 1:** Anagram finder, finds all single/multiple word anagrams of a 
word/words.

**Assignment 2:** Implemented a hybrid trie that uses multiway trie nodes and DLB nodes. The hybrid trie seamlessly transitions when necessary from DLB nodes to multiway nodes to save memory and increase speed.

**Assignment 3:** Modified the author's LZW program which uses 12 bit codewords for compression. Added in variable length codewords (9 - 16 bits) as well as an option to reset the dictionary when it becomes full (useful for compressing folders with different file types.)

**Assignment 4:** Basic chat server with encryption. Modify the professor's chat server programs to include RSA encyrption as well as two different types (substitute and additive) symmetric encryption.
